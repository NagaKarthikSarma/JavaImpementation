Thread Concepts:
DeadLock
Interrupt()
notify() 
notifyall()
join()


Executor service:
          ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3) 
          Thread t1= new Thread();
          executor.execute(t1);
          
          
          executor.shutdown();
          
 
 CountDownLatch:
 class A{
   public countDownLatch 
   
   public classname(CountDownLatch latch){
   this.latch =latch;
   }
   public void run(){
   latch.countdown();
   }
   public static void main(String[] args){
   
   countDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(5);
    Thread t1= new Thread(latch);
   
   to stop main method:
   latch.await();
